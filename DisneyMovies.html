                Troy Bolton (Zac Efron), the star athlete at a small-town high school, falls for nerdy beauty Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) at a holiday
                karaoke party. When they return to campus, Troy and Gabriella audition for the upcoming school musical.
                Meanwhile, the jealous Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) conspires to squelch their chances.
                The two must struggle to make it to auditions while also meeting their existing obligations to the basketball team and the academic decathlon.
